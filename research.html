		the correctness of the system depends not only on the
		logical correctness of result of computation, but also
		on the time on which results are produced. If the
		response time violates the timing constraints imposed by
		the dynamic of the environment, the system has to pay a
		cost for the violation. Hence, it is essential that the
		timing constraints of the system are guaranteed to be
		met. The cost of failure in a real-time system
		differentiates real-time systems into mainly three types
		of real-time systems: Hard, Soft and Firm. In my

		<p>Energy consumption is an increasing concern in
		cyber-physical real-time systems, especially when
		processing elements operate on battery power. Embedded
		real-time distributed systems must support
		increasingly complex applications such as distributed
		video surveillance, processing a large amount of
		sensor data, etc. The energy consumption can be
		optimized in recent processor by the mean of DVFS
		(Dynamic voltage and Frequency Scaling), and DPM
		(Dynamic Power Management). The first allows to
		calibrate the operating frequency to reduce the
		dynamic energy. In DPM, the processor (core) static
		energy may be reducing by "switching off" some
		processor components such as clocks. Reducing the
		frequency and changing processor mode affects the
		processor performances by increasing the execution
		time and reducing the processor capabilities.</p>
		<p> I focus on how to use such techniques to reduce
		the energy consumption while guaranteeing the respect

		<p>Many modern GPOS (General Purpose Operating

		provides three real-time scheduling policies:
		SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR which are based on fixed

		SCHED_DEADLINE , which provides resource reservation
		on top of Earliest Deadline First (EDF). Thanks to the
		temporal isolation property, the latter is
		particularly useful when mixing real-time and non
		real-time workloads in the same system. These
		scheduling policies are highly configurable, and can
		be used to implement either global scheduling or
		partitioned scheduling by properly set the tasks' CPU
		affinities or using the cpuset mechanism. In global
		scheduling, load balancing is implicite however as
		tasks are arranged in a single queue, they are allowed
		to migrate, thus generating an overhead due to
		migrations.</p>
		<p> I investigate load balacing techniques for
		partitioned scheduling by allowing permannent and
		temporary migrations without breaking the temporal

	      <p> The evolution and development of semiconductor
	      technology has made possible the integration of billions
	      of transistors on a single chip. With this technological
	      explosion, designers are able to develop Integrating
	      Complex (ICs) functional elements into a single chip,
	      known as a Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC). The
	      first-generation MPSoCs used buses to allow information
	      exchange between components. With the increase of PEs in
	      a single chip, the bus is highly contented, which limits
	      the scalability and becomes quickly a bottleneck for
	      high performances. Networks on-Chip (NoC) has been
	      proposed as an alternative solution for scalable
	      interconnection between PEs and power efficiency.</p>

	      <div>
		<p>
		  In a typical real-time system, several tasks are in
		  concurrence on different resources and are subject
		  to share data. When executing real-time tasks on a
		  NoC-based architecture, the shared data has to be
		  routed between the computing units where
		  communicating tasks are allocated. The needed time
		  to route data from its source to its destination is
		  called communication latency. Latency has to be
		  bounded to ensure that each task instance has been
		  executed without violating the real-time constraints
		  (no later than its deadline). NoC components
		  (routers and network interfaces, ...) are designed
		  to maximize network utilization without taking into
		  account predictability and temporal behavior of
		  communications, thus they are not suitable to
		  real-time systems.</p>
		<p>
		  The goal of research I lead in this topic is to
		  bound latency by including additional components
		  onto routers in the goal of : (i) considering the
		  urgency of a real-time communication, (ii) reduce
		  the worst case latency bounds (iii) without
		  sacrificing the performances of non-real-time task
		  using the less possible architectural modifications.

	      <div>
		<p>In 2D-mesh NoCs, tiles are arranged in a grid such
		that typically each tile has 4 neighbors: left, right,
		north and south. This topology is simple to implement
		and easy to manage compared to more complex
		topology. Thus, it receives more attention in NoC
		research community. Nevertheless, when the network
		traffic is very high, network performance can
		drastically fall because of the contention and
		congestion that may be generated in frequently used
		routers (central ones). In a general 3D package
		system, two or more SoCs are stacked vertically so
		that they occupy less space and/or have greater
		connectivity. Such techniques have been applied onto
		NoC architectures by overlaying two or more 2D NoCs on
		the same SoC allowing shortening communication path
		compared to a 2D NoC architecture however as
		communication medias are physically overlaid they may
		be a source of heating, hence failure.</p>

		<p>I participate in this project by including formal
		methods to analyze the behavior of 3D NoCS compared to
		2D NoCs and by defining at design time, the most
		appropriate communication media disposals to provide
		real-time guarantees.</p>
